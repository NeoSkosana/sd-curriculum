    "Dev Notes":
      - Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story
      - Do not invent information.
      - If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story.
      - If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here.
      - Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story,  meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks.

# Story 1.1: Cook Registration & Profile Creation

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** new cook,
**I want** to register for an account and create my kitchen profile (including kitchen name, address, and contact information),
**so that** I can establish my presence on the platform and begin setting up my food business.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new user can navigate to a "Cook Registration" page.
2.  The registration form includes fields for email, password, kitchen name, kitchen address (street, city, state, zip), and phone number.
3.  All fields are required.
4.  Upon successful submission, a new cook account is created in the system.
5.  The cook is redirected to their kitchen profile page, which displays the information they just entered.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create the Cook Registration page (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Design the registration form with all the required fields.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement the front-end for the registration form.
- [ ] Task 2: Implement the backend for cook registration (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create the `POST /api/cooks/register` endpoint.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement the logic to create a new cook in the in-memory database.
- [ ] Task 3: Create the Kitchen Profile page (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Design the kitchen profile page.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement the front-end to display the cook's information.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Implement the `GET /api/cooks/:id` endpoint to fetch the cook's data.

## Dev Notes

*   **Backend:**
    *   Set up a basic Node.js/Express server.
    *   Define API endpoints for:
        *   `POST /api/cooks/register`
        *   `GET /api/cooks/:id`
    *   Implement data models for `Cook`.
    *   Use a simple in-memory "database" (e.g., a JavaScript array/object) for initial data storage. No persistent database is needed for this epic.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Create a simple React application using `create-react-app`.
    *   Implement components for:
        *   Registration Form
        *   Kitchen Profile Display
    *   Use `fetch` to interact with the backend API.
    *   Basic, clean UI using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

### Testing

*   No specific testing standards have been defined yet. For now, focus on manual testing to ensure all acceptance criteria are met.
