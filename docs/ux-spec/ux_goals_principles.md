## **2. Overall UX Goals & Principles**

Based on the PRD, our design will be guided by the following principles:

* **Empowering Simplicity:** The interface must be incredibly intuitive, especially for cooks who may have low technical literacy. Every task should be achievable in the minimum number of steps.  
* **Trustworthy & Inviting:** The design aesthetic will be warm and professional, using clean layouts and high-quality food imagery to build trust and appeal.  
* **Clarity First:** All labels, instructions, and flows will be unambiguous. The user should always know what to do next.  
* **Mobile-First by Default:** Every design decision will be made for a mobile viewport first, then adapted for larger screens.
