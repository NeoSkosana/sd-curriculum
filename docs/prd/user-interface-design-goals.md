## **3. User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should be clean, friendly, and empowering. For cooks, the app should feel like a simple, supportive tool that helps their business grow. For customers, it should be a delightful way to discover local culinary gems. The design will prioritize clarity and ease of use over feature density.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **For Cooks:** A simple, form-based dashboard for managing their kitchen and menu. Actions should require a minimum number of taps.
* **For Customers:** A visually-driven, map/list-based discovery experience. The focus is on browsing and finding food easily.

### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Cooks:**
  * Profile Setup/Edit Screen
  * Menu Management Dashboard (add/edit/delete items)
  * Order Dashboard (view and manage incoming orders)
* **Customers:**
  * Home/Discovery Screen (list/map of nearby kitchens)
  * Kitchen Detail & Menu Screen
  * Simple Order Summary/Checkout Screen

### **Accessibility**

The application will adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, ensuring high-contrast text, keyboard navigability, and screen-reader compatibility.

### **Branding**

The branding should be warm, inviting, and trustworthy. The visual style will use vibrant colors associated with food, clean typography, and high-quality images of meals. The logo should evoke a sense of "home" and "community".

### **Target Device and Platforms**

The primary platform is the mobile web, accessible through any modern smartphone browser (Chrome, Safari).
