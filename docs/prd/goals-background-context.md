## **1. Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* To provide home cooks with a simple digital platform to market their meals to a local audience.
* To offer local residents an easy way to discover and order authentic, affordable home-cooked food.
* To create a functional MVP within a 6-month timeframe using the specified tech stack.
* To validate the market need for a hyper-local, informal food marketplace.

### **Background Context**

The project addresses a gap in the South African informal food market. Talented home cooks lack a low-cost, easy-to-use tool to formalize their offerings and reach beyond their immediate vicinity. This PRD outlines the requirements for an MVP that serves as a digital noticeboard and ordering system, connecting these cooks with customers in their neighborhoods. The focus is on simplicity and facilitating the initial connection, leaving complex logistics like payments and delivery out of the initial scope.
